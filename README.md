Hello, I'm Elie Millon (aka Ayane).

A developper since 1996, I started with QBasic extracted from a CD-ROM of Windows 95 but laked lead to learn more (the web was in infant stage) and mainly make text based games (style Game Books).

I really started in 2003 with PHP where my first application was an application to transform a model 3D on an undocumented format (Warcraft3 MDLX) and followed with Visual Basic 6.

In 2006 I was working on server games in C++ for MMORPG until 2016, where I learned to make real-time server applications with an heavy load and how to optimize, debug, and many more skills and languages (like ASM).

Concurrently in 2009-2012 I was a professional student and have worked in web agencies in PHP, Javascript, XSLT, ...

From 2017 to today I am a lead developper on a professional tool (C# Asp.Net monolithic application of 15 years) and are working to rewrite it as micro services to the cloud (Amazon AWS: Node.js, GraphQL) and the UI in Angular.
